Implementation in C of "Handwritten Digit Recognition" in Michael Nielsen's book --"Neural Networks and Deep Learning."

The efficient expression of Python (with Numpy) hides most of the details, and the C++ version shows it all. 

This version does not consider performance efficiency; the purpose is to clarify the principle and implementation method of gradient descent.
